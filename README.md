# Enigma - CS61B

This project is a replication of the World War II German encryption machine Enigma. I have created a generalized simulator that operates on user inputted descriptions and codes to encode and decode.
I worked with Java's Hashmap, ArrayList, String, and Scanner in order to read user inputs, handle string manipulation, and mapping data for the encoder.
